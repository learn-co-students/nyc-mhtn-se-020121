# Practical Object Oriented JavaScript

## Key Questions

* What is the relationship between JS objects and functions?
* How does OO work in Ruby again?
* How can I create a class using ES6 syntax?
  * What is the prototype of an object?
  * How can I give that class a constructor? What is a constructor anyway? Have I written one before?
  * How can I make a new instance of that class?
* How can I write an instance method for a JS class?
* How can I write a class method for a JS class?
* How can we do inheritance with ES6?
    * `super`?

## Here are the general steps for adding a class to your project:

- Create a file for our class and add a `<script>` tag linking to that file
- Create a class and a constructor method that takes in the animal object, so we can save some _data_/_state_ to our instance
- Create a render method that's responsible for displaying the animal component, and adding it to the DOM
- Add event listeners to any events associated with the component
